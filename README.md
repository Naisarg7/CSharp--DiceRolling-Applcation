# CSharp--DiceRolling-Applcation
Basic Dice Rolling C# - Console Application Game 

This project is a C# dice rolling console based application game wherein two dice are rolled for 36000 times 
and the user is asked to enter the sum made by two dice ( between 2 to 12, because max value of a die is 6 and minimum is 1 ).

After that, the user is presented with the number of times that value ( sum ) had occured while rolling. If the user has entered
wrong input, ( let's say less than 2 or greater than 13 ) , an error is thrown and then, the user is asked whether to try again ( continue )
or not ( exit ).

The console again asks the user if they want to continue or exit, after completion of first time automatically.
